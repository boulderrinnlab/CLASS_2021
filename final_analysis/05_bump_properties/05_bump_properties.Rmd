```{r setup, include=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
source("../../util/_setup.R")
source('../../util/intersect_functions.R')
```

Read in the peak occurrence matrix. 
```{r, include=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
num_peaks_df <- read_csv('../01_global_peak_properties/results/num_peaks_df.csv')
peak_occurrence_df <- read_csv('../01_global_peak_properties/results/peak_occurence_dataframe.csv')
peak_occurrence_lncrna <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, gene_type == "lncRNA")
peak_occurrence_mrna <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, gene_type == "protein_coding")
```


Now filter out the promoters in bump 1 (defined as 1-50 DBPs) and bump 2 (defined as 250-350 DBPs)
```{r bumps, include=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
bump1_promoters <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, peak_occurrence_df$number_of_dbp < 46)
bump1_promoters <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, peak_occurrence_df$number_of_dbp > 1)

bump2_promoters <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, peak_occurrence_df$number_of_dbp > 230)
bump2_promoters <- filter(peak_occurrence_df, peak_occurrence_df$number_of_dbp < 352)
```


Determine the percent of mRNA and lncRNA in bump 1 and bump2.
```{r mRNA and lncRNA percentages, include=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
#percent of mRNA and lncRNA bump 1
bump1_mrna_promoters = filter(bump1_promoters, bump1_promoters$gene_type == 'protein_coding')
bump1_lncrna_promoters = filter(bump1_promoters, bump1_promoters$gene_type == 'lncRNA')

n_bump1_mrna_promoters <- nrow(bump1_mrna_promoters)
n_bump1_lncrna_promoters <- nrow(bump1_lncrna_promoters)

percent_mrna_bump1 <- n_bump1_mrna_promoters/(n_bump1_mrna_promoters+n_bump1_lncrna_promoters)
percent_lncrna_bump1 <- n_bump1_lncrna_promoters/(n_bump1_mrna_promoters+n_bump1_lncrna_promoters)

print(paste('The percent mRNA in bump1 (low binders) is ',percent_mrna_bump1))
print(paste('The percent lncRNA in bump1 (low binders) is ',percent_lncrna_bump1))

#percent of mRNA bump 1
bump2_mrna_promoters = filter(bump2_promoters, bump2_promoters$gene_type == 'protein_coding')
bump2_lncrna_promoters = filter(bump2_promoters, bump2_promoters$gene_type == 'lncRNA')

n_bump2_mrna_promoters <- nrow(bump2_mrna_promoters)
n_bump2_lncrna_promoters <- nrow(bump2_lncrna_promoters)

percent_mrna_bump2 <- n_bump2_mrna_promoters/(n_bump2_mrna_promoters+n_bump2_lncrna_promoters)
percent_lncrna_bump2 <- n_bump2_lncrna_promoters/(n_bump2_mrna_promoters+n_bump2_lncrna_promoters)


print(paste('The percent mRNA in bump2 (high binders) is ',percent_mrna_bump2))
print(paste('The percent lncRNA in bump2 (high binders) is ',percent_lncrna_bump2))
```
