Load in our consensus peaks and peak occurrence matrices.

Now load in promoter and gene body information for lncrnas and mrnas.

Convert GRanges to data frames and filter peak occurrence for lncrna or mrna peaks.

Convert them to data frames.

Now do some plotting! Plot distribution of DBPs for all promoters.

Now do the same, but separate lncRNA and mRNA promoters binding events.

Now, calculate peak occurrences for gene bodies and see if a similar trend occurs.

Let's plot and see!

And now, separate by gene body type (lncRNA or mRNA).
