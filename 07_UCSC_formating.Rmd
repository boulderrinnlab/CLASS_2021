Here we are going to upload our peak files from MACS (NF-Core Chipseq) to the
UCSC Genome Browser.

Unfortunately there are some file format issues. We will deal with this in bulk
with Rcode. But for now let's mannually inspect a .broadpeak file.

The nextflow MACS output is technically a bed6 +3 -- this means thatn it's a
standard bed file with 3 additional fields.

ALL .BED require first threee fields to be :

```
Chr start stop
```

This is our first step towards understanding Iranges or Genomic Ranges. These
files will always be listed in "intervals" or ranges of features.

Let's take a look at the first line of MACS broad.Peaks file:

```
chr1	827072	827564	ASH2L_R1_peak_12	61	.	5.22849	8.708	6.12277
```

So we see this peak is on chromosome 1 and the range of the peaks starts at 
827072 and peak end range is 827564. Those are minimal requirements for a .bed file.

We see additional information here now:

Column 4: peak name
Column 5: peak score #int(-10*log10pvalue) 
Column 6: strand
Column 7: fold change at peak summit
column 8: -log10pvalue at peak summit (pval)
column : -log10qvalue at peak summit (qval)


Cool so now we know what is in the file, but we still need to do some formatting 
to get the file into UCSC which loves standard Bed3 but get's confused if there is
more and needs to have you tell it what type of file it is.

IGV was nice as the files go straight in -- but UCSC will have a lot of information
we can use to understand our results and better visualization outputs.


Ok lets do the final formatting. If you head your broad.Peak file you will see
some weird looking chromosome names like this:

```
GL000218.1	97231	97515	ASH2L_R1_peak_1	36	.	4.45278	6.12847	3.69243
GL000219.1	99163	100121	ASH2L_R1_peak_2	48	.	3.60875	7.41229	4.88736
GL000251.2	2243479	2243999	ASH2L_R1_peak_3	18	.	3.61082	4.06835	1.81115
GL383563.3	324323	324616	ASH2L_R1_peak_4	45	.	4.90069	7.02559	4.52199
KI270729.1	160787	161306	ASH2L_R1_peak_5	104	.	6.52922	13.3587	10.4542
KI270830.1	16789	17306	ASH2L_R1_peak_6	17	.	3.52976	3.99846	1.75013
```

UCSC is ont going to like this at all :) It doesn't start with "Chr" then it will
fail. These are contigs of the genome that aren't yet places on a chromsoome so its
cool they kept them in but UCSC prefers complete genome draft sequences. 


So let'remove those entries (usually only a dozen or so) 

Ok so now the only issue is that UCSC is going to want a header to know what 
information is in the file. Luckily broadPeak is so common we just have to tell
UCSC that in a header like this:

```
track type=broadPeak name="ASH2L_2_old"
```

That wasn't so bad to format since we had so few files. Later we will write a script
to remove all the noncannonical chromosomes and add header with name of file.
In the meantime here is something to think about for changing the files en masse:

We need to get rid of the contigs first:

```
grep -e chr ASH2L_R1_peaks.broadPeak > ASH2L_R1_peaks_ucsc_chr.broadPeak
```

Then we need to add a header for UCSC to know how to read in the file.

```
track type=broadPeak visibility=3 db=hg38 name="ASH2L_rep1" description="ASH2L"
```


Ok now are peak files are ready to load into UCSC. Have a go!

Earlier we saw that FASTQ (~1.5GB) files are the raw reads >> BAM (~1GB) file that is an index
of where those reads are in the genome >> BIGWIG (~200MB) this is a compressed version of
BAM alignments that allows you to visualize the "RAW data" relative to the peak files.

BAD NEWS: You can't upload BigWig directly to the UCSC browser :(

You have to have a URL to the file that UCSC can grab in Cache etc. Good news is
we have the files publically available for everyone on AWS console. One cheap 
solution if you are going to be generating a lot of data is to use "S3 storage"
on the AWS console. This is really cheap storage for a lot of data that you can
make public or keep private. You can grab the BigWig files for today here:


ChIP BigWig ASH2L rep 1,2
https://class2021.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ASH2L_R1.mLb.clN.bigWig
https://class2021.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ASH2L_R2.mLb.clN.bigWig

Input BigWig

Let's go load these into UCSC browser !
