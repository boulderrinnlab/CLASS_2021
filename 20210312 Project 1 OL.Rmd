## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
res_genes <- X2020_peak_occurence_df %>% filter(X2020_peak_occurence_df$reservoir == 1)
res_gene_names <- res_genes$gene_name
#goal: get a list of reservoir gene names from the old data.

res_genes_2021 <- peak_occurence_df %>% filter(peak_occurence_df$gene_name %in% res_gene_names)
res_gene_names_2021 <- res_genes_2021$gene_name
#goal: filter out the same genes in the new data

head(res_gene_names_2021)

clean_res_genes_2021 <- res_genes_2021[-c(475),]
which(grepl('ENSG00000258325.2', clean_res_genes_2021$gene_id))
clean2_res_genes_2021 <- clean_res_genes_2021[-c(704),]

comparison_df <- merge(res_genes, clean2_res_genes_2021)

#need to remove ENSG00000254093.9 and ENSG00000258325.2
#done

total_dbp_2021 <- sum(clean2_res_genes_2021$number_of_dbp)
total_dbp_2020 <- sum(res_genes$number_of_dbp)

#normalizes the dbp count

normalized_ratio_res21_res20 <- clean2_res_genes_2021$number_of_dbp/total_dbp_2021 %/% res_genes$number_of_dbp/total_dbp_2020

#finds the ratio of expression of each gene, not normalized to total reads.

clean2_res_genes_2021 <- cbind(clean2_res_genes_2021, normalized_ratio_res21_res20)

clean2_res_genes_2021 <- subset(clean2_res_genes_2021, select = -c(9) )

#adds the ratio to the 2021 df. Should show which genes are up and down regulated in liver cells.


normalized_2021 <- clean2_res_genes_2021 %>%
    dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_type, number_of_dbp) %>%
    dplyr::rename(num_dbp_HEPG2 = number_of_dbp)
  
normalized_2020 <- X2020_peak_occurence_df %>%
    dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_type, number_of_dbp) %>%
    dplyr::rename(num_dbp_K562 = number_of_dbp)

comparison_df <- merge(normalized_2020, normalized_2021)

#Michael wrote this but I don't really get it. It didn't do anything interesting and the comparison df is wack.

#Okay now it's time to plot this shit.
ggplot(clean2_res_genes_2021, aes(x = gene_name, y = normalized_ratio_res21_res20)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
